- use modelerror for all model errors in controllers 
- tidy all in view and inline css to site.css
- tidy up all scripts in renders and call them in layout
(tidying up left to future extension)
(- add description for each role in models and startup and display it on admin panel)(for future extention, currently hardcoded)
- auto logout users on browser close (it has something to do with browser, but how do you force delete session data?) (not urgent, future extention)
- option to add quantity of products to cart(future extension)
- turn everything you can to async(not urgent, future extention)
- make admin able to change other account's passwords
- if you press submit on a form fast, then multiple requests will be sent and processed... how to avoid this?
(example) create a new product and press the create button fast, and duplicate products will be created
